## Q&A
**Q: I cannot interact with a box zone, what do I do?**<br>
**A:** Check that the box zone height difference between MinZ and MaxZ is not too big, this in my experience breaks the target somehow.
<br>
<br>
**Q: All of the crafting items in my inventory are missing images, how do I fix this?**<br>
**A:** Please read the 4th step of the installation guide.
